### Assignment: sgd_backpropagation
#### Date: Deadline: Mar 22, 23:59
#### Points: 3 points
#### Examples: sgd_backpropagation_examples

In this exercise you will learn how to compute gradients using the so-called
**automatic differentiation**, which is implemented by an automated
backpropagation algorithm in TensorFlow. You will then perform training
by running manually implemented minibatch stochastic gradient descent.

Starting with the
[sgd_backpropagation.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/02/sgd_backpropagation.py)
template, you should:
- implement a neural network with a single _tanh_ hidden layer and
  categorical output layer;
- compute the crossentropy loss;
- use `tf.GradientTape` to automatically compute the gradient of the loss
  with respect to all variables;
- perform the SGD update.
