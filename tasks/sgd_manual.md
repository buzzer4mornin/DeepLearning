### Assignment: sgd_manual
#### Date: Deadline: Mar 22, 23:59
#### Points: 2 points
#### Examples: sgd_manual_examples

The goal in this exercise is to extend your solution to the
[sgd_backpropagation](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl114/2021-summer#sgd_backpropagation)
assignment by **manually** computing the gradient.

While in this assignment we compute the gradient manually, we will nearly always
use the automatic differentiation. Therefore, the assignment is more of
a mathematical exercise than a real-world application. Furthermore, we will
compute the derivatives together on the Mar 16 practicals.

Start with the
[sgd_manual.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/02/sgd_manual.py)
template, which is based on
[sgd_backpropagation.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/02/sgd_backpropagation.py)
one. Be aware that these templates generates each a different output file.

In order to check that you do not use automatic differentiation, ReCodEx checks
that you do not use `tf.GradientTape` in your solution.
